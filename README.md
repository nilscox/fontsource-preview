@fontsource/\* - View all fonts from [@fontsource](https://fontsource.org/) in a single page.

This is just a webapp allowing to browse fonts quickly, in a virtualized list (thanks to
[react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window)). The fonts are loaded on-demand (lazy loading), when
they are displayed on the viewport. This is why it may glitch a little when scrolling fast.

The webapp is deployed on [koyeb](https://koyeb.com), and updated every day.
